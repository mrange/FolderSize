Release Notes: 
 * Added an installer for those users that prefer that too zip files
 * Added a context menu choice to Windows Explorer : 'Estimate with FolderSize.Win32' 
   which lanches FolderSize.Win32 from that folder

Known issues: 
 * Fails to load on Windows 2K (It's certainly possible to make it work on Windows 2K if 
   there's a demand for it) 
 * Sometimes misses the last update to the foldertree on virtual machines / remote 
   desktops. Workaround: Drag the foldertree or click another window, this should force 
   a refresh. I'm working on it
