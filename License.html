               This license governs use of the accompanying software. If you use the software,

               1. Definitions
            </h2>
            <p>
               The terms &quot;reproduce,&quot; &quot;reproduction,&quot; &quot;derivative works,&quot;
               and &quot;distribution&quot; have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright
               law. A &quot;contribution&quot; is the original software, or any additions or changes
               to the software. A &quot;contributor&quot; is any person that distributes its contribution
               under this license. &quot;Licensed patents&quot; are a contributor's patent claims
               that read directly on its contribution.</p>

               conditions and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive,
               worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare
               derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative
               works that you create.

            <p>
               (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions
               and limitations in section 3, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,

               derivative works of the contribution in the software.

               (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim
               are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the
               software ends automatically.

            <p>
               (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright,
               patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.
            </p>
            <p>
               (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do
               so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your
               distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object
               code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.
