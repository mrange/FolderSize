# Roadmap FolderSize

## FolderSize.Win32
* Status: Mature
* A foldersize application written in C++ with the explicit intent to reduce the system requirements to a minimum to further reduce deployment pain.
* For those that are interested the source is of course available from codeplex although you need boost to compile it ([www.boost.org](www.boost.org)). I will arrange a setup environment subproject later on.

## FolderSize.Console
* Status: Stalled
* A foldersize application written in C++ with the explicit intent to reduce the system requirements to a minimum to further reduce deployment pain.
* Console UI to be usuable on headless windows servers
